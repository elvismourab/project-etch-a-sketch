# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of <b>[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)</b> - Foundations Course.

## Description

- This program creates a simple drawing application where the user can draw on the grid with different colors and shading. The user can also adjust the size of the grid and clean their drawing.
- It utilizes an interactive grid of squares inside a container. Each square is a div element and its height and width are set based on the size of the container and the number of squares in the grid.
- There are several buttons that allow the user to interact with the grid:
  - The “NEW GRID” button prompts the user to enter a new grid size, then clears the container and creates a new grid with the specified size - it accepts values from 1 to 100.
  - The “BLACK PEN”, “RAINBOW PEN”, and “SHADING PEN” buttons change the color of the squares when the mouse hovers over them. The color can be black, a random color (for the rainbow pen), or a gradually darkening shade of black (for the shading pen).
  - The “CLEAN” button clears the container and creates a new grid with the current squareSize.
